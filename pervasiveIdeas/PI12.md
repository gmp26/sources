### Summary

Mathematicians are always looking to generalise and to specialise: these are two of the central activities in mathematics.  Generalising is about starting with specific cases and becoming less specific.  Specialising is about starting with something general and seeing what it tells us about a specific case.  It might seem that generalising is therefore more important (or harder) than specialising, but that is not always true.
