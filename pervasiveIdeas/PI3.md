### Summary

When mathematicians talk about _proof_, they are referring to the process of justifying a statement in such a way that we can be certain that it is true.  This sometimes uses a named type of proof (such as _proof by induction_ or _proof by contradiction_), but need not.  The crucial thing is that a proof is an irrefutable argument that demonstrates the truth of a statement.
