### Summary

When mathematicians talk about _proof_, they are referring to the process of justifying a statement in such a way that we can be certain that it is true.  This sometimes uses a named type of proof (such as _proof by induction_ or _proof by contradiction_), but need not.  The crucial thing is that a proof is an irrefutable argument that demonstrates the truth of a statement.

AND THEN WE CAN HAVE ARTICLES AND OTHER RESOURCES ABOUT PROOFS.  IN PARTICULAR, THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PERVASIVE IDEA WHERE THERE WILL BE RESOURCES OF SEVERAL TYPES, AS WE NEED TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT PROOF BY CONTRADICTION AND PROOF BY INDUCTION ETC.
