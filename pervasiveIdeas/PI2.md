### Summary

Linearity is a rather key idea in mathematics, and occurs all over the place.  We might detect linear behaviour when one variable grows linearly in another.  That is, changing one variable by a certain amount always leads to the same change in the dependent variable.  Functions that behave linearly are important for preserving certain sorts of mathematical structure.
