### Summary

Averaging crops up all over the place in mathematics.  We are familiar with the idea of finding an average of some data (indeed, we have more than one type of average that we can use), but there are many other contexts where what we are essentially doing is finding an average.  Often we don't explicitly describe it in that way, but being alert to the connection can be very helpful.
