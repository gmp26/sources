### Summary

An important part of finding a new mathematical idea is often to make a _conjecture_.  This might also be called a prediction, or a hypothesis.  A conjecture is something that we believe to be true, perhaps based on some evidence or previous experience, but that we have not yet proved to be true and that may in fact turn out not to be true.

AND THEN WE NEED AT LEAST ONE ARTICLE WITH EXAMPLES OF CONJECTURES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE TRUE AND THAT HAVE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE TRUE, AND EXAMPLES OF CONJECTURES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN DECIDED EITHER WAY.
