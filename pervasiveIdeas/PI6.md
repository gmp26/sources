### Summary

Axioms in mathematics are like the rules of the game: the starting points that we all agree on.  We cannot start proving things until we have made explicit our initial assumptions.  Axioms are statements that we agree to assume are true, and we then go on to deduce other statements from those.  There isn't a single set of axioms that gets used across all of mathematics; rather, mathematicians use different sets of axioms depending on what they are doing, and have used different sets of axioms at different points in history.
