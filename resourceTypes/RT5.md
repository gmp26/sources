description: >
  A task that gives students an opportunity to engage with material that would otherwise be out of their grasp.  For example, it might be a 'proof sorter' activity that enables students to understand the components of a proof and their ordering, although creating the proof from scratch would be beyond the students.  Or it might be a 'hide and reveal' task, which has a number of sections that can be revealed one at a time, to offer some structure (e.g. subtasks leading to a big task) that helps students to make progress on something that would otherwise be too big or demanding.
