description: >
  An illustration of a standard technique, or a standard way of presenting an argument, for example, through carefully chosen examples.  Crucially the worked examples are followed by problems for students to try themselves, and while these problems are related to the worked examples, they require more than just 'templating' (changing a few numbers in the worked examples).  Another sort of resource in this category could be an invitation to the student to come up with their own examples, as a way of getting a feel for the scope of an idea or technique.
