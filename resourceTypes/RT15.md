  A resource that puts the mathematics into context, perhaps by offering a historical perspective, or describing the mathematicians who worked on it, or linking it to areas of current research, or illustrating how it leads on to further topics (e.g. at university level).  They would not all need to be accessible to all students: sometimes it might be appropriate to have something that is designed for a student with a particular interest (e.g. for a student with an interest in Physics, who is studying A-level Physics alongside Maths).  This sort of resource might be an article or video, for example.  It might, but need not, contain questions for the student to consider while reading or watching.
