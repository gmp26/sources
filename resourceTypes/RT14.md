description: >
  A problem for which students (probably) have the required mathematical knowledge, but where the challenge is identifying how to get started, what tools might help, and how to apply the relevant mathematical knowledge.  Students might tackle such a problem at home, for a challenge, as these problems are often more suited for individual consideration than classroom collaboration.
