description: >
  Something for students to get stuck into.  It might start with just an interesting context, or with some initial questions to explore, but the emphasis is on students posing their own questions, and pursuing the avenues that interest them.  This is good for developing various mathematical skills, and gives students the opportunity to work on things that really inspire them.  These investigations might be good for after-school clubs, or individual projects.
