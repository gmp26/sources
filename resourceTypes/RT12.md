A mixed collection of problems for further practice.  Students (or teachers) might pick a problem at random, or might rummage through the bag to find a problem that appeals to them.  Working on these problems is not necessary for understanding the topic, but it is useful to have these problems available for additional practice and for variety.  Many of them might be fairly short.
