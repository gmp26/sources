````

An exploratory task, designed to be presented with little preamble.  Students rapidly get engaged with the task, which then gives them an opportunity to discover the relevant ideas or concepts for themselves, perhaps by working collaboratively with others.  This might well be followed by some sort of summary, or exposition, or worked examples, to formalise what has been found.
