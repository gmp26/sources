description: >
  Students are often used to problems being posed in such a way that they have all the information that they require for a solution, and no more.  Problems (especially from the real world) are very often not like this, and so resources of this type will give students the opportunity to develop the skills needed to deal with this.  Some problems might not contain enough information to answer a question, and so students will have to find some additional information (perhaps by making assumptions, perhaps by asking an expert (teacher), perhaps by carrying out an experiment, perhaps by researching online).  And some problems might contain too much data, so that part of the challenge is to identify the useful information.
