  Students will regularly want to test their understanding, both of a particular topic and of their ability to draw together ideas from a number of topics.  Review questions might include some past examination questions, alongside other fairly closed problems and other problems designed to get students to look back over what they have learned.  They might be pitched at different levels, and might be flagged to show whether they incorporate ideas from other topics.
