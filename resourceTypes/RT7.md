description: >
  This is a set of problems that have been designed and that should be thought of as a single entity.  It might be that the problems build on each other, so that by the end they are requiring more sophistication but in a way that is accessible to students who have worked through the whole set.  Or it might be that by working on all of the problems, the student is naturally prompted to explore some underlying structure or to make a generalisation.
