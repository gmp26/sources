  Students sometimes seize the first idea that comes to mind, when it might not necessarily be the most effective.  These problems draw students' attention to the thought that there might be several ways to tackle a problem, or to represent an idea.  They might do this not only by setting a problem that can be tackled in several ways, but also by illustrating some of these ways, or suggesting several starting points.
