Pervasive Ideas
===============

Our tube map shows the connections between many stations, and each station contains some mathematical content.  There are, however, many important mathematical ideas that do not fit naturally at a station, because they somehow span a number of stations.  These are our _pervasive ideas_.

We have grouped these ideas loosely into three families.

__Concepts__ are mathematical ideas that occur across content strands.

__Context__ is all about how mathematical ideas fit together in a bigger picture.  This family includes applications of mathematical ideas to the real world, indications of how mathematical ideas come together in more advanced mathematical topics, and historical background, for example.

__Processes__ are about the way in which we do mathematics.

We believe that it is important and useful for students and teachers to be aware of these pervasive ideas as they are studying mathematics, and so we have highlighted occurrences of pervasive ideas at stations as well as giving information and resources for each pervasive idea at its own page.  We hope that you will explore these as you travel through the CMEP tube map.
