Here's a game for two players.

<div class="well">
Player 1: Choose a positive integer that is greater than 1.  Call it $n$.

Player 2: Choose two positive integers, say $a$ and $b$, in such a way that $ab$ divides $n$ (that is, $n$ is a multiple of the product $ab$).

If $a$ divides $n$ or $b$ divides $n$, then Player 1 wins.

If neither $a$ nor $b$ divides $n$, then Player 2 wins.
</div>

1.  Play this game against a partner a few times, to get a feel for the rules.  Can you find a strategy for Player 1?  Can you find a strategy for Player 2?

2.  Why does your strategy work?  Are you _sure_ that it works?  There are some hints below that might help you to structure your proof, but do try to come up with your own ideas before you look below.
