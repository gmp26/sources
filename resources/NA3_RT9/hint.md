With buckets containing 10 litres and 13 litres, are there some amounts that are easier to make than others?

If you can make a certain amount, does that mean that there are some other amounts that we immediately know we can make?

Can you rephrase the problem, for example using algebra?

What mathematics do you know that might be relevant?
