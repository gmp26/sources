Take any pair of numbers, say 9 and 14.

Take the larger number, 14, and count up by that amount :

<p class="lead text-info">
 14,   28,   42,   56,   ...
</p>

Then divide each of the values by 9, your chosen smaller number, and look at the remainders.

<p class="lead text-info">
 5,   <strong class="text-error">1</strong>,   6,   2,   ...
</p>

**Notice there's a one.**

Now do the same again but using different numbers, say 7 and 12.

Counting in twelves and dividing each result by 7 :

<p class="lead text-info">
 12,   24,   36,   48,   ...
</p>

<p class="lead text-info">
 5, 3, <strong class="text-error">1</strong>,   6,   ...
</p>

**Again somewhere in those remainders is a one.**

Pick the pairs how you like, somewhere there'll always be a one - won't there?

What actually happens?

Why?
