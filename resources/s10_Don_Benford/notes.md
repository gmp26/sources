Frank Benford published a rule in 1938 (that had been found previously by Simon Newcomb, in 1881) that e.g. if you look at a large enough sample of real data e.g. people's house numbers, around a third of the numbers will start with a 1.


the frequency of the numbers of digits, d, follows a log law:
F(d) = log(1 + 1/d).

values from this frequency distribution are shown:

students could see how this distribution compares with
real-life data e.g.

- house numbers of people in their class or year group
- populations of towns in the UK
- lengths of longest rivers in the world
- populations of countries in the world
-lead digits of scientific constants
