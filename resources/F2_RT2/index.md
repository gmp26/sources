The following five functions have been plotted accurately on the chart below

$y=\sqrt{x}$ $\quad\quad y=x^2$ $\quad\quad y=x$
$\quad\quad y=(x^2+x)/2$ $\quad\quad y=2\sqrt{x}-x$

![Curves](curves.png)

Which is the $x$-axis and which is the $y$-axis? Which curves correspond to which functions?

Imagine that you wish to plot a route between $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$. Can you find a function that does this without intersecting any of the existing curves, except at the endpoints?

What other curves can you plot which intersect the existing curves only at the end points?
