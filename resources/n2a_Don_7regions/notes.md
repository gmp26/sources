I'm fairly confident that there are 18 solutions altogether and these are not too difficult to find.
[1 way totalling 13, 3 ways totalling 14, 2 ways totalling 15, 6 ways totalling 16, 2 ways totalling 17 , 2 ways totalling 18 and 1 way totalling 19]

Impossibility proofs: circles cannot total 16 with a 4 in the centre; you cannot make totals greater than 19 or less than 13; you cannot use anything other than a 1 in the centre of the circles total 13.... etc

Proofs to try: placing letters (a to g) in the regions, going left to right and then down:
a + b = g + f, b + c = d + g and c + f = a + d; b + e + g (etc) must be even.
