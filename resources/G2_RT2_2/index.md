The plan here is to incorporate two NRICH resources ([Parallel lines](http://nrich.maths.org/5609) and [Perpendicular lines](http://nrich.maths.org/5610)), and then to extend this slightly to think about when two lines do or don't intersect, and when they do to be able to find the point of intersection.
