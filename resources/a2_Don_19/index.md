Using any four consecutive digits along with any operations and brackets, can you make 19?

(2 + 4) x 3 + 1 
4 x 5 – 3 + 2;    2 + 3 x 4 + 5
and several other ways using these digits.
 
3 x 6 + 5 – 4 

5 x 6 – 4 – 7, and     4 x 5 + 6 – 7 

(8 – 6) x 7 + 5 

9 x 8 ÷ 6 + 7,and     8 ÷ 6 x 9 + 7
(this is a tough one...)

It’s interesting to note that
4 x 5 – 3 = 3 x 4 + 5
and that
5 x 6 – 4 = 4 x 5 + 6
Prove that a generalisation works for any three consecutive numbers.
