Here's the first part of the formal solution.

<div class="chalk">
This paragraph is chalky with max-width 300px

This is good for informal doodling in between formal thinking.
</div>

Here's some more formal work.

<div class="chalk pull-right">
This paragraph is chalky and appears to the right of paragraph 3.

It's good for annotating.
</div>

This is the final part.
