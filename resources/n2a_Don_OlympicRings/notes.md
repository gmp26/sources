using all of the digits 1 to 9 can students arrange these in the nine spaces of the olympic rings so that the totals in the circles are the same?

this task is made more interesting by there being at least three substantially different answers and you can prove that the lowest possible total for the circles is 11 and the highest is 15

you can also prove that the sum of the overlap numbers must be a multiple of 5 and that circle totals of 12 and 15 are impossible.
