This neat problem is one of Anita Straker's.

The number 726 can be formed by adding a 3-digit number with its reversal: 462 + 264 and there are two other ways to do this.

Find three ways to do this for a) 707 (fairly easy) and b) 766.

Find the ten numbers between 700 and 800 that can be formed from a number plus its reversal.



What common property do they have?
Why?
