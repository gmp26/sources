In this interactivity, you can specify two positive integers (whole numbers) and the computer will draw a corresponding diagram.

<div class="well">
Experiment with a few examples, and then consider the questions that follow.
</div>

<div class="row-fluid">
<iframe src="http://nrich.maths.org/psum/picture-this/full/?mobile=1" class="nrich-embed" style="width:700px;height:550px"></iframe>
</div>

_Interactivity reproduced from [Picture This!](http://nrich.maths.org/psum/picture-this/).  This will be tweaked to have a full screen version (in such a way that the numbers are still visible when displayed full screen).  We might also lose the option of a non-spiral version._

<div class="well">
* Given two positive integers, can you draw the corresponding diagram?
* Given a diagram, can you determine the corresponding pair of positive integers?
</div>

You should now have a good understanding of the relationship between the diagram and the pair of positive integers.  There are many questions that you might now ask yourself.

<div class="well">
Investigate the questions that interest you.  You might want to make some conjectures and then try to prove (justify) them or to disprove them by finding counterexamples.
</div>

Then you can look at our list of questions below.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question1">
Question 1
</button>

<div id="question1" class="collapse">
What is the relationship between the side length of the smallest square in the diagram and the pair of positive integers?
</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question2">
Question 2
</button>

<div id="question2" class="collapse">
How many steps (different colours) can we have?  Which pairs of integers give many steps and which give few?
</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question3">
Question 3
</button>

<div id="question3" class="collapse">
How can we record the information from the diagram in the form of equations?

When might the diagram be more convenient?  When might the equations be more convenient?
</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question4">
Question 4
</button>

<div id="question4" class="collapse">
What is the point of the process captured by this diagram?  What is it useful for?  When might it be more or less useful than our existing techniques?
</div>
