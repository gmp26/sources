In this interactivity, you can specify two positive integers (whole numbers) and the computer will draw a corresponding diagram.

<div class="well">
	Experiment with a few examples, and then consider the questions that follow.
</div>

INTERACTIVITY FROM JASON AND PSUM (WITH FULL SCREEN OPTION AND A LARGE ENOUGH FONT SIZE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE VISIBLE WHEN THE FULL SCREEN VERSION IS DISPLAYED ON A DATA PROJECTOR)

<div class="well">
	* Given two positive integers, can you draw the corresponding diagram?
	* Given a diagram, can you determine the corresponding pair of positive integers?
</div>

You should now have a good understanding of the relationship between the diagram and the pair of positive integers.  There are many questions that you might now ask yourself.

<div class="well">
	Investigate the questions that interest you.  You might want to make some conjectures and then try to prove (justify) them or to disprove them by finding counterexamples.
</div>

Then you can look at our list of questions below.

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question1">
	Question 1
</button>

<div id="question1" class="collapse">
	<p>
		What is the relationship between the side length of the smallest square and the pair of positive integers?
	</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question2">
	Question 2
</button>

<div id="question2" class="collapse">
	<p>
		How many steps (different colours) can we have?  Which pairs of integers give many steps and which give few?
	</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question3">
	Question 3
</button>

<div id="question3" class="collapse">
	<p>
		How can we record the information from the diagram in the form of questions?

		When might the diagram be more convenient?  When might the equations be more convenient?
	</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-action" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#question4">
	Question 4
</button>

<div id="question4" class="collapse">
	<p>
		What is the point of the process captured by this diagram?  What is it useful for?  When might it be more or less useful than our existing techniques?
	</p>
</div>
