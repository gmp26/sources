What do we mean by a _circle_?

It's the set of all points at some fixed distance from some fixed point.

For example, we might talk about the circle of radius 3 with centre $(-1,2)$ --- this is the set of all points that are at distance 3 from $(-1,2)$.

Now we're going to try to express this set of points as a set of solutions to an equation, in much the same way that we can describe a line as the set of solutions to an equation (for example, the line with gradient $\frac{1}{2}$ passing through $(0,1)$ is precisely the set of all points $(x,y)$ such that $2y = x + 2$).

When is the point $(x,y)$ at distance 3 from $(-1,2)$?

Here's a useful picture.

The coordinate system gives us a very natural way to get a helpful right-angled triangle from this.

If the point $(x,y)$ were placed differently relative to $(-1,2)$, then we might get different triangles.

Now Pythagoras's theorem helps us to find the distance between the points $(x,y)$ and $(-1,2)$: it's $$\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (2-y)^2}.$$

Find the corresponding expressions for the distances in the other possible diagrams.</div>

So $(x,y)$ lies on the circle of radius 3 with centre $(-1,2)$ if, and only if, $$\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (2-y)^2} = 3.$$

This, in turn, is satisfied if, and only if, $$(x+1)^2 + (2-y)^2 = 9.$$  (In one direction this is clear: by squaring both sides of the first equation we obtain the second.  In the other direction, we can use the fact that $\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (2-y)^2}$ must be positive to justify taking the positive root on both sides.)

So the equation of the circle of radius 3 with centre $(-1,2)$ is $$(x+1)^2 + (2-y)^2 = 9.$$

Expand out the brackets and experiment with different ways of writing this equation.  Which way(s) do you find most convenient, and why?</div>
