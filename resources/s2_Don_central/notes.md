you might present the set of numbers and ask students to consider (and record) what an 'average' value might be for this set - a representative number, standing for the whole set.

These class values can then be compared

there are several more 'averages' than are normally considered
I think there's some value in introducing this variety before homing in on the more regularly used values
some discussion of which value is 'best' (advantages/disadvantages) might follow the calculations.
