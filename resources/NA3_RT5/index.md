We denote the product of the first $20$ natural numbers by $20!$ and call this $20$ factorial.

(a) What is the highest power of $5$ which is a divisor of $20$ factorial? Just how many factors does $20!$ have altogether?

(b) Show that the highest power of $k$ that divides $500!$, where $k$ is an integer and $k(t+1)>500>kt$ is

$$[500/k]+[500/k2]+\dots+[500/kt],$$

where the square brackets are used to denote the integer part of the number inside.

(c) How many factors does $n!$ have?
