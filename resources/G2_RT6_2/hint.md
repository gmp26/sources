If we pick two (distinct) points, then there are many circles that pass through both points.  Can you say anything about the centres of these circles?

If we pick three (distinct) points, then the number of possibilities seems to shrink dramatically.  What can you say about where the centre of the circle must be?  Is there always a circle passing through any three distinct points?

You will need to think about which number of points specifies a unique circle in order to do the second part (finding the equation of the circle from the specified points).
