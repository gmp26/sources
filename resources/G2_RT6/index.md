Something inspired by [this NRICH resource](http://nrich.maths.org/5871).

I think that we can turn this into a more substantial resource, perhaps making more explicit the multiple approaches and representations that could be involved.

I think that we could also extend it so that it has parts that aren't just about equations of straight lines.
