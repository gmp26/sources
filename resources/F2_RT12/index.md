The implicit equation
$$(x^2 + 2ay - a^2)^2 = y^2 (a^2 - x^2)$$
represents a family of functions, with each member of the family corresponding to a different value of $a$.

Sketch some graphs of functions in this family corresponding to different values of $a$.  You might want to rearrange the equation into the form $y = f(x)$ first.

What might be the domain of the function $f$?
