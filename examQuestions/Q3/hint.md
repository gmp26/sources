I want to find the equation of the circle passing through three points.  So I suppose that I could write down the equation of a general circle, and then substitute in some points and try to solve the equations.

But that sounds a bit like messing around with algebra.  Perhaps there's another approach that's less labour-intensive?

I'm trying to find the circumcentre of three points---that would be a good start.  So I want a point that's equidistant from the three given points.  I think that I know something about the locus of points equidistant from _two_ given points.  Perhaps I can use that...

How can I decide whether a line is tangent to a circle (as opposed to not touching it at all or cutting through the circle)?
