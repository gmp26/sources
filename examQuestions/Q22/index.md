Find the integer, $n$, that satisfies $n^2<33127<(n+1)^2$. Find also a small integer $m$ such that $(n+m)^2-33127$ is a perfect square. Hence express $33127$ in the form $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers greater than $1$.

By considering the possible factorisations of $33127$, show that there are exactly two values of $m$ for which $(n+m)^2-33127$ is a perfect square, and find the other value.
