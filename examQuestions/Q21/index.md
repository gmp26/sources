Show that, if $n$ is an integer such that $$(n-3)^3+n^3=(n+3)^3,\qquad\qquad(\ast)$$ then $n$ is even and $n^2$ is a factor of $54$. Deduce that there is no integer $n$ which satisfies the equation $(\ast)$.

Show that, if $n$ is an integer such that $$(n-6)^3+n^3=(n+6)^3,\qquad\qquad(\ast\ast)$$ then $n$ is even. Deduce that there is no integer $n$ which satisfies the equation $(\ast\ast)$.
