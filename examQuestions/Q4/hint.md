<:= style(chalk) :>
I'm allowed to assume that $c^2=25(1+m^2)$, and I want to think about the solutions of the simultaneous equations $y=mx+c$ and $x^2+y^2=25$.  I think that I need to do some algebra.

For the second part of the question I want to find two lines of the form $y=mx+c$ which touch the circle and pass through $(2,11)$.  Perhaps the relationship that I have just found between $c$ and $m$ will be helpful.
