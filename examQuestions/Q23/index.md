A curve is given by the equation  
$$y = ax^3 - 6ax^2 + (12a + 12)x - (8a + 16), \qquad (\ast)$$  
where $a$ is a real number. Show that this curve touches the curve with equation  
$$y = x^3 \qquad (\ast\ast)$$  
at $(2,8)$. Determine the coordinates of any other point of intersection of the two curves.

(i) Sketch on the same axes the curves $(\ast)$ and $(\ast\ast)$ when $a = 2$.
(ii) Sketch on the same axes the curves $(\ast)$ and $(\ast\ast)$ when $a = 1$.
(iii) Sketch on the same axes the curves $(\ast)$ and $(\ast\ast)$ when $a = -2$.
