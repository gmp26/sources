We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation to be  

$$(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)-1.$$  

Hence,  

$$(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)(d+1)=2010.$$  

Now, expressing $2010$ as a product of primes gives $2010=2\times3\times5\times67$. As it has only four prime factors, these must be $a+1$, $b+1$, $c+1$, and $d+1$ in some order. This means that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ must be $1$, $2$, $4$, and $66$ in some order.  

Thus 

$$a+b+c+d=1+2+4+66=73.$$
