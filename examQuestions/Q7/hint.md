<:= style(chalk) :>
Drawing a diagram to get a feeling for the problem is always a good start. It looks as if I can get a rough idea as to where the two circles will lie.

But I want to get the equations of the two circles, so I might want to start from the general equation of a circle. There are three conditions which my circles need to satisfy and all of these conditions should give me relations between the coordinates of the centre of the circle and its radius. Perhaps I'll end up with some equations that I can solve.

<:= style(chalk) :>
If I want to prove that a given line is a **common** tangent to two circles, I think that I could just check this line is tangent to the first circle, and then that it's also tangent to the second circle.

I know a couple of useful facts about tangents to circles. One is that a tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point where they meet.  And another is that the tangent and the circle intersect at exactly one point.  Perhaps that might help.
