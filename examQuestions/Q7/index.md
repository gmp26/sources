Find the equations of the two circles which each satisfy the following conditions:

(i) the axis of $x$ is a tangent to the circle,

(ii) the centre of the circle lies on the line $2y = x$,
  
(iii) the point $(14,2)$ lies on the circle.

Prove that the line $3y = 4x$ is a common tangent to these circles.
