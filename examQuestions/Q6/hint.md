If I knew the centre and the radius of the circle, I could just show that the distance from the point $P$ to the centre of the circle is less than the radius. But how do I find the centre and the radius? If I was given the equation of the circle in its standard form, I could just read them off....

<:= style(chalk) :>
I notice that the centre of any circle that has radius of $5$ units and that passes through $P$ has to lie a distance of $5$ away from $P$. But I also want my circles to touch the given circle, so this should give me further information about the the centres of the circles. And then I could consider all the points which satisfy both conditions.
