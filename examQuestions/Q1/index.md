Prove that the points whose coordinates satisfy the equation $$x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0$$ lie on a circle. State the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the length of its radius.

Prove that the circles $$x^2+y^2-20x-16y+128=0$$ and $$4x^2+4y^2+16x-24y-29=0$$ lie entirely outside each other, and find the length of the shortest distance from a point on one circle to a point on the other.
