(i) Suppose that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers that satisfy the equation
$$a^3 + 3b^3 = 9c^3.$$
Explain why $a$ must be divisible by $3$, and show further that both $b$ and $c$ must also be divisible by $3$. Hence show that the only integer solution is $a = b = c = 0$.

(ii) Suppose that $p$, $q$ and $r$ are integers that satisfy the equation
$$p^4 + 2q^4 = 5r^4.$$
By considering the possible final digit of each term, or otherwise, show that $p$ and $q$ are divisible by $5$. Hence show that the only integer solution is $p = q = r = 0$.
