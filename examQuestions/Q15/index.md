Show that the perpendicular distance of the point $(h,k)$ from the straight line $x\cos\alpha+y\sin\alpha=p$ is the numerical value of $$h\cos\alpha+k\sin\alpha-p.$$  Calculate the coordinates of the centres of the two circles of radius $5$ which pass through the point $(4,4)$ and touch the straight line $3x-4y-28=0$.
