A number of the form $1/N$, where $N$ is an integer greater than $1$, is called a _unit fraction_.

Noting that
$$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}\quad\mbox{and}\quad\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{12},$$
guess a general result of the form
$$\frac{1}{N} = \frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}$$
and hence prove that any unit fraction can be expressed as the sum of two distinct unit fractions.

By writing the previous equation in the form
$$(a − N)(b − N) = N^2$$
and by considering the factors of $N^2$, show that if $N$ is prime, then there is only one way of expressing $1/N$ as the sum of two distinct unit fractions.

Prove similarly that any fraction of the form $2/N$, where $N$ is prime number greater than $2$, can be expressed uniquely as the sum of two distinct unit fractions.
