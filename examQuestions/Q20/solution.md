From the question, we know that the primorial of $6$ is less than $210$, so no number less than $6$ will have a primorial of $210$. The primorial of $7$ is $2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210$. Since $8$, $9$ and $10$ are not prime numbers, they too have a primorial of $210$. Any number greater than or equal to $11$ will have a primorial of at least $2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 = 2310$. So there are exactly $4$ integers with a primorial of $210$.
