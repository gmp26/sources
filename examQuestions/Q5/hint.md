I want to show that the two circles touch.  That means that they intersect at exactly one point. 

So I need to solve simultaneous equations. I could solve the first quadratic equation for $x$ in terms of $y$ and then plug this into the second equation to solve for $y$. But this might get really messy.

Instead, perhaps I could try to get rid of the square terms right at the beginning.
