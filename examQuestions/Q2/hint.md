I know the standard equation of a circle. If these points all satisfy an equation like that for some centre and radius then I think that will show they lie on a circle. However, I think this could lead to some quite messy algebra. Maybe I could do it in a different way?

If I can find a point that is equal distance away from each of my four points then they must lie on a circle with centre at that point. Taking the first and second points, I could find the locus of all points equal distance from them.  Then I could do the same for the second and third points....
