The points $S$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ have coordinates $(s,ms)$, $(t,mt)$, $(u,nu)$ and $(v,nv)$ respectively. The lines $SV$ and $UT$ meet the line $y = 0$ at the points with coordinates $(p,0)$ and $(q,0)$, respectively. Show that
$$p = \frac{(m - n)sv}{ms - nv},$$

and write down a similar expression for $q$.

Given that $S$ and $T$ lie on the circle $x^2 + (y - c)^2 = r^2$, find a quadratic equation satisfied by $s$ and by $t$, and hence determine $st$ and $s + t$ in terms of $m$, $c$ and $r$.

Given that $S$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ lie on the above circle, show that $p + q = 0$.
