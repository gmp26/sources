Sketch the graph of  
$$y = \frac{5x}{x^2 -1},$$  
showing clearly the three asymptotes.

Use your graph to find the number of real roots of the equation  
$$kx-1 = \frac{5x}{x^2 -1},$$  
when $k$ is a positive constant.

Show also that there is a range of negative values of $k$ for which the equation has only one real root. (The precise range of values of $k$ is not required.)
