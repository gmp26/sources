CMEP Privacy Policy
===================

This policy statement relates to personal data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998, held in connection with the operation of CMEP.

The policy explains what information is held about individual people by the CMEP system, how it is gathered and how it is used. Details of the data held or logged are given in the appropriate section below. This information is used to help support CMEP users, for system administration and bug tracking, and for producing usage statistics for management and planning purposes.

Users are reminded that access to CMEP is via the CUDN and that the [Privacy Policy Statement for the CUDN](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/privacy/cudnprivacy) is also relevant.

Access to CMEP logs is restricted to CMEP site maintainers where an appropriate site-specific privacy policy is in place.

These logs are currently held for 12 months.

Logs are used to create summary statistics which may be made publicly available. Summary statistics do not include personal data.

Relevant subsets of this data may be passed to computer security teams at the University Computing Service (e.g. CamCERT) as part of an investigation into computer misuse.

Personal information is not passed to any third party except where required by law.

CMEP data is backed up at a facility managed by the site maintainers. The backups are held for the purpose of reinstatement of the data, e.g. in the event of failure of a system component.


Data held by the CMEP system

User-dependent system information

For users who identify themselves to the system with their CRSid, CMEP uses information supplied by the University lookup service. 

For users who identify themselves using one of the pilot school logins, no information is retained.

Information held in the Cambridge Mathematics Education Project group on Linked In is managed by Linked In and covered by [the Linked In Privacy Policy](http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=hb_ft_priv)

###Site-specific tracking information

CMEP logs contain detailed information about user activity within each site, including the date and time of when site-specific information was viewed and/or updated, the address of the machine from which the access was made, the browser identification information and information about the referring web page.

The site does not make use of third party systems for tracking usage such as Google Analytics.
