##Key Questions

Unless specified otherwise, functions at this station are from subsets of the real numbers to the real numbers.

1. What are the connections between algebraic and graphical representations of a function?

1. What are the graphs of key functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and the modulus function?

1. What do we mean by a _root_ of a function?

1. What kinds of symmetry might a function have?

1. What does it mean to say that a function is _odd_, _even_, or _periodic_, and what are some good examples of functions with some or all of those properties?

1. What is an _asymptote_, and what are some good examples of functions that have one or more asymptotes?

1. What types of behaviour might a function $f(x)$ display for large or small values of $x$?

1. What does it mean for a function to be _convex_ or _linear_, and why are these properties interesting?

1. How can we sketch a function given in parametric form?
