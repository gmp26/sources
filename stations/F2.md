##Key Questions

1. What are the connections between algebraic and graphical representations of a function?

1. What are the graphs of key functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and the modulus function?

1. What do we mean by a _root_ of a function?

1. What kinds of symmetry might a function have?

1. What does it mean to say that a function is _odd_, _even_, or _periodic_, and what are some good examples of functions with some or all of those properties?

1. What is an _asymptote_, and what are some good examples of functions that have one or more asymptotes?

1. What types of behaviour might a function $f(x)$ display for large or small values of $x$?

1. What does it mean for a function to be _convex_ or _linear_, and why are these properties interesting?

1. How can we sketch a function given in parametric form?
