##Key Questions

1. If we can write a function in the form $$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n,$$ how do we expect the coefficients $a_n$ to depend on $f$?

1. What are some good examples of functions that can be written as power series like this?

1. What are some good examples of functions that can't be written as power series like this?
