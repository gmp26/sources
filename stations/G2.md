##Key Questions

1. Which of our key examples of geometrical objects in two or three dimensions can we describe as regions of $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ bounded by lines or planes?

1. What do we mean by _Cartesian coordinates_?

1. How can we describe circles and lines (in two dimensions) algebraically?

1. How can we consider parallel and perpendicular lines using algebra?

1. How can we use algebra to find the intersections of geometric objects?

1. Which shapes can easily be described algebraically, and which is it harder to express in this way?
