##Key Questions

1.  What does it mean to say that expectation is linear?

1.  When is it true that $\Var(X+Y) = \Var(X) + \Var(Y)$?

1.  If we know the distributions of $X$ and $Y$, what can we say about the distribution of $X+Y$, $XY$ and other functions of $X$ and $Y$ (perhaps in some special cases)?
