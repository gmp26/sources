##Key Questions

1.  How can we count the possibilities arising from a succession of choices?

1.  Does it matter whether we care about the order of our choices?

1.  How does the factorial notation work?

1.  What do we mean by _permutations_ and _combinations_?

_(Note during drafting: A3 depends on P2.  Should this station about counting be on the Probability line, or should it float around not being part of any tube line but linking with other stations?)_
