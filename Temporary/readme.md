This is a folder for storing stuff that's not ready yet, e.g. so that it's not visible to teachers during the workshops.  These files will be worked on in the future, so I don't just want to delete them.

I have temporarily removed a couple of dependencies in remaining stations, so as not to break things.  I want to keep a record of that here.

C7 depends on F4

C13 depends on F6

Bullet points removed from station G2 for the duration of the workshops:

1. Which of our key examples of geometrical objects in two dimensions can we describe as regions of $\mathbb{R}^2$ bounded by lines? [was the first bullet point]

1. Which shapes can easily be described algebraically, and which are harder to express in this way? [was the last bullet point]
